# Analysing Uber Trips

## This repo goes on solving real world problem using Python, NumPy, Pandas, EDA, and Matplotlib!!

Performed various exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks.such as showing the first and last 10 records of the dataset, displaying the dimensions and size of the dataset, checking for missing values, getting summary statistics, dropping missing values, finding unique start and stop locations, identifying the most popular starting and dropping points, determining the most frequent route taken, and plotting a bar graph of purpose vs miles (distance). Additionally, it generates a plot showing the count of trips vs category of trips and calculates the percentage of miles clocked under business and personal categories.

The goal of the project is to:
* Analyzed data to identify travel patterns, such as purpose, routes, and distance, and improve overall travel efficiency.
* Developed effective pricing strategies through loyalty programs, utilizing techniques such as offering coupons and monthly customer passes to retain and acquire customers.
